## üöÄ Quickstart

You can run the application locally by following these steps:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server, typically at `http://localhost:5173`.

## üåç Supported Browsers

This application supports the latest, stable versions of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari. It's optimized for modern web browsers.

## üì¶ Dependencies

## üçç State Management

We utilize [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) for managing the application state, allowing for efficient state sharing between components. You can inspect the state using [Vue DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vuejs-devtools/ljjemllljcmogpfapbkkighbhhppjdbg).

## üß™ Testing

We have a comprehensive testing setup to ensure code quality:

```sh
# Run unit tests
npm run test

# Run tests with UI
npm run test-ui

# Generate test coverage report
npm run coverage

# Run end-to-end tests with Playwright
npm run test-e2e
```

For developing and testing components in isolation, we use Storybook:

```sh
npm run storybook
```

## ‚ú® Code Quality

We maintain high code quality standards through automated tools:

```sh
# Run linters
npm run lint

# Format code with Prettier
npm run format

# Run type checking
npm run type-check
```

## üèóÔ∏è Build & Deployment

To build the application for production:

```sh
# Standard build
npm run build

# Build with bundle analyzer visualization
npm run build-analyze
```

These commands will create an optimized build in the `dist` folder.

To preview the production build locally:

```sh
npm run preview
```

## üîç Pre-commit Checks

We enforce code quality and consistency through pre-commit checks using Husky and lint-staged. These checks automatically run:

- TypeScript type checking
- Code formatting with Prettier
- Linting with ESLint and OxLint
- Running unit tests related to changed files

The configuration for these checks can be found in the `lint-staged` section of the package.json file.
